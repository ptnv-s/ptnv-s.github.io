(WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Welcome to my corner of the web. I'm Pratinav Seth, a data science student and aspiring AI researcher, passionate about using technology to tackle real-world challenges.

As I approach the end of my undergraduate studies at Manipal Institute of Technology, I've had the privilege of working on projects in computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing. From addressing climate change to improving healthcare, I'm continually inspired by AI's potential to make a positive impact.

My internships at Mila Quebec AI Institute, Bosch Research, and KLIV Lab IIT Kharagpur have been invaluable, teaching me how much there is to learn in this rapidly evolving field. I'm grateful for the mentors and collaborators who've guided me, and for the opportunities to contribute to research in areas such as: using satellite imagery to detect abandoned oil wells, enhancing autonomous driving systems, incorporating domain knowledge in neural networks for medical image analysis, and analyzing the Explainability of modern deep neural networks.

Recently, I have been developing NLP solutions for agricultural query resolution and exploring multi-modal model architectures for super-resolution and segmentation in a parameter-efficient manner, with applications across various domains.

A significant part of my journey has been shaped by my involvement in student organizations at Manipal. As a researcher with Mars Rover Manipal, I have worked on diverse problem statements, co-led a AI research group, and mentored undergraduate students. Co-founding The Data Alchemists allowed me to share my passion for AI and data science with fellow students. As Co-President of the Research Society, I've worked to foster a culture of undergraduate research across various technical domains.

While I'm proud of my accomplishments, including publications at AI conferences <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DwBn1fcAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>, I know this is just the beginning of my journey. There is so much more to discover and many brilliant minds pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

I created this site to share my projects and experiences, hoping they might be useful to fellow students or anyone curious about AI's applications. I'm always eager to learn from others and explore new ideas in this fascinating field.

Thank you for stopping by. I hope you find something interesting here, and I welcome any thoughts or questions you might have.
